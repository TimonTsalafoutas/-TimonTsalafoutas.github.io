<!-- Nintendo Switch Heading and Description-->
<p><h3 class="switch">Nintendo Switch</h3></p>

<p>Nintendo's Switch made up for Wii U's failure with the nintendo Switch . Even though it is 
behind Xbox one in sales it has a unique feature that makes it portable. It also has very good exclusives and some
games that were only on PC and no other console like Cuphead. Later Nintendo released Nintendo Switch lite which is 
basically the same but comes at a cheaper price without a console dock, making it exclusively portable.</p>
